# VidTip 

(the project previously known as StashVideo)

A hackathon project from FOSSCON 2014

# Purpose

Mobile web app for anonymously submitting video tips (ex. witnessed violence or other non-YouTube friendly videos).

Leverages the [Stash API](http://stash.my) for encrypting the video so that the website admins/video viewers should have no knowledge of the submitter. Messages submitted through the app would be consumed through the other side of the Stash API (messages/list) to mantain anonymity.
